I am a PhD student working as staff research scientist in [parallel programming lab][1], Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany, under supervision of [Prof. Dr. Felix Wolf][2] and [PD. Dr. Ali Jannesari][3]. We work towards the goal of parallelization and performance optimization.

I am greatly interested into bringing HPC into Deep Learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Due to that, I am currently collaborating with UC Berkeley, [ASPIRE Lab][4] on creating a framework for exploiting highest inference runtime performance from these networks. I am working on developing high-efficiency convolution layers, auto-tuning CNN execution, GPU programming optimization and implementing Domain Specific Language.
